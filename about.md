I am a graduate student at Cal State Univ. of East Bay studying Statistics. I am very interested in Machine Learning, Big Data
and Visualization. While at the university I also co-founded a very popular Club: The Data Science Club, this is something I'm quite proud of. With the club we hope to leave a foundation of Data Science in the department. I tend to present a lot in these meetings, and you might find some of those make their way here.

I have always loved computers and tend to do some non Statistical/Machine Learning programming on the side as well. Currently I am diving deep into scala. My favorite programming languages are of course R and Python, I have also done some cool work with D3 and Javascript. I have some knowledge of C and Lisp from my High School Hacker days and still enjoy watching the awesome stuff others can do with them either on youtube or livestreams! As I mentioned Scala is quickly becoming a language that I enjoy to use.

**My set up** at the moment is quite simple. I use (and love my) Lenovo Thinkpad t440s with an Intel core i5. It is currently running Ubuntu 15.10 and previously Fedora 23 (the latter had too many issues with Web Browser ... idk). I cant wait for the next LTS 16.04 some time in April! When it comes to software it's pretty straightforward, if I'm coding in R I use Rstudio, if in Python I do either Jupyter Notebooks or Sublime. When working on spark or hadoop clusters on my server I use emacs as my console editor (use to be my main, but Sublime is just so good). Anything else, like Scala, Javascript, and HTML (for this site) I use Sublime.

**I like to listen to music**. Especially when I am reading/programming/working. Mainly pandora, they clearly have the best recommending system (spotify can't even compare). My favorite stations on Pandora are, <em>Toro y Moi, Radiohead, Massive Attack</em> as well <em>Chiptune</em> and <em>Chillstep (genre)</em> on occasions.
